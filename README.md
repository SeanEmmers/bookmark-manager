# Bookmark Manager

### To set up the databases

Connect to `psql` and create the `bookmark_manager` database:

```
CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
```

To set up the appropriate tables, connect to the database in `psql` and run the SQL scripts in the `db/migrations` folder in the given order.

Follow these same steps but create a second 'bookmark_manager_test' database
